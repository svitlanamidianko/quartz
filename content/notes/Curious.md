# Main source of reads to fuel curiosity
I love using curius.app (aka social reading / bookmark too) to source good readings, discuss & geek out about tech, life, society, products, spirituality, cultures with my friends. Curius gives me a huge dose of brain stimulation every day and I could not recommend this tool more. 

Follow [this link](https://curius.app/svitlana-midianko2) to see what I am readings! Let me know if you decide to join and need help with onboarding (happy to send personalized read recs!).


# Books I am reading
I just recently gained back my attention span (it was a long journey!) and now read quite a bit. I keep Notion database of books I am reading. See it [here](https://ssmidianko.notion.site/Books-1328e3b56b17486dbfed92e384b3c2e0).

Also another tracker [here](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/127356542?ref=nav_mybooks), if you use goodreads. (So many tools, I knowðŸ˜°)
