# Thanks 
So many people helped me become the person I am today. I would love to pay forward, see ways I can help in the end of the page. 
In  the meantime, this is an ongoing list of many thanks.
- To my parents and sister. Thanks to my mom for trusting me and letting me do an exchange when I was 15. 
- To Camila for always encourging me to be aware of morals and ethics; for making me take philosophy class that sparked philosophy curiousity
- To Galyna, my scout leader, who taught me how to survive in the woods for 10 days with no basic amenties and build my own bathroom, kitchen, shower out of wood. She is a super-hero. 
- Vicky, Josie
- To 100 drivers who were open to share the best words of life wisdom while I hitchhiked. (Also, huge thanks to luck for not being murdered, killed, or raped during this)
- To Nor
- To Vita
- To my minerva classmates

# How can I help?


P.s.: this idea was inspired by my Google APM friend, Yash.
