Telegram","content":"# Introduction\n_Written in April 2022_\n\nTelegram is a messaging service founded in 2013 by brothers Pavel and Nikolai Durov. The application is now [the top 6](https://www.statista.com/statistics/258749/most-popular-global-mobile-messenger-apps/)¬†used messaging apps with ~550M Monthly Active Users. Its mission is to \"provide a secure means of communication that works everywhere on the planet ([source](https://telegram.org/faq?setln=ru)).\"\n\nIn this case study, I argue that Telegram delivers a superior User Experience by differentiating itself in a market and applying the leading UX/UI principles. I propose a new feature that should make its market positioning even more unique.\n\n\u003e **Thinking thoughts:**\n\u003e Telegram differs from all of its competitors in its business structure as it has not been monetizing (and hence generating revenue) and solely relied on charities. How much does this factor influence Telegram UX success?\n\n# Soo, what is this product about?\n### Feature set (ft. Kano Model)\nTelegram offers a wide range of features, which  [Kano Mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kano_model) can describe quite well. The model distinguishes between 3 types of features - must haves (basic), performers, and delighters.\n\nN. Kano, the creator of this model, suggests that to satisfy customer satisfaction and differentiate a product, one needs to have must-haves and performance features that are at least as good as competitors. Next, each¬†simple extra feature is what defines user‚Äôs experience the most and contributes to the \"wow\" effect.  \n![kanomodel](/tg/kanomodel.png)\n\nOn top of must-haves and excellent performance, Telegram has a wide range of delightful features which various user segments benefit from. For example, blockchain enthusiasts prefer enhanced security, programmers use developer tools, and general users love customizability. \n![[notes/images/fig2.png| inlR ]]\n### Differentiation - chats *and* channels\nWhat makes Telegram stand out is that it affords two things: \n1.  the¬†exchange of information in `1-to-1` chats or `many-to-many` group chats; \n2. the dissemination of information in `1-to-many` channels (that could have up to 200,000 subscribers!). Consequently, Telegram makes itself a one-stop shop for anything¬† information-related.\n\n![fig3](/tg/fig3.png)\n\nAlso, these features have a lot of delightful additions. For example, chats afford reactions, stickers, video circles, polls, video-calls, and location sharing, whereas channels also allow for Clubhouse-like audio-chats.\n\n### UX/UI principles in use\n\nMany principles have been developed in the design community that reinforce great user experience. Still, **simplicity** is one of the most useful heuristics to follow. Approaching product development with a ‚Äúless is more‚Äù attitude creates an intuitive and straightforward UX flow associated with positive feelings for the end-user, empowering them and showing that anyone is wise to use the app.\n\nNorman (1988) describes one set of UX/UI principles in his book ‚ÄúDesign of Everyday Things.‚Äù Telegram affords all-related functions around information and uses a bunch of **signifiers** in the form of icons to show it. Also, the combination of high-speed performance and **immediate feedback** generates a frictionless flow for the end-user.\n\n![fig4](/tg/fig4.png)\n\nNext, Telegram also upholds both internal and external consistency.\n![fig5](/tg/fig5.png)\nAnother fantastic UX principle is empowering users to combine small sub-tasks into bigger grouped activities. For example, think about when winding down to sleep, we would often stop reading the emails (task) and instead might open a meditation app or book (task). Here, the bigger activity to be done is to unwind and prepare yourself for sound rest. Similarly, Telegram recently took the first step in creating activity-based functions by enabling folders, which you can use to separate, for example, work and personal chats.\n![fig6](/tg/fig6.png)\n\n### Power move: addition of meaningful communication medium\nLastly, I argue that Telegram **created a powerful [medium](http://worrydream.com/#!/TheHumaneRepresentationOfThought/note.html)** for sharing our thoughts and staying in touch. Current versions of WhatsApp and other messaging apps allow only to send a voice message or record a video (save it on your phone) and send it to the chat. At the same time, Telegram created a feature of video-circle messages that allows recording of in-moment videos that only live in Telegram. This way of communication enables messages to be more intimate, especially when knowing that it was not pre-recorded.\n\n# There is always room for improvement\n\nTelegram has become a **super-app** for all tasks regarding information. Super apps are great because they reduce the amount of decision-making we need to do, as there is one place where you can accomplish them all. This all together leads to **minimization of customer effort.**\n\nHowever, any application can be improved, and given that Telegram now has found its product-market fit and should scale, I suggest that the objective of an proposed feature should be to acquire that Late Majority of users from¬†[the Technology Adoption Life Cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_adoption_life_cycle). For this, I argue that Telegram needs another compelling feature that would be unique in the messaging services landscape.\n\nBefore brainstorming, it is important to outline the user segments and user persona.\n![fig7](/tg/fig7.png)\n\nGiven the huge rise of the creator and influencer economy, I focus on writers/influences from the channels category. The user persona fitting this category is shown below.\n![fig8](/tg/fig8.png)\n\nTo address the user persona's needs, I suggest implementing a feature that replicates offline relationships more closely. Specifically, Joley seems to hang out with various people and friend groups. She shares different types of updates and details with each of those groups and individuals. She has her followers divided into \"close friends\" and \"friends \" on Instagram.\" However, she shares her main content on Telegram, and she wishes that there were more levels of intimacy on top of Instagram's taxonomy of ‚Äúfriends‚Äù and ‚Äúclose friends‚Äù.\n\nFor example, an influencer might have one channel called \"Updates from amazing Joley,\" in which she shares all kinds of thoughts, videos, photos, and findings with 10,000 of her subscribers. But among those subscribers, some users are patrons, close friends, partners, or family. In its current configuration, the Telegram channel only allows the \"all or nothing\" option - sharing a message there with 10,000 people or no one.\n\nI suggest granulating the options by allowing a writer to share a specific message with different people. Then, for example, if one particular personal photo only needs to be shared with close friends, Joley can choose a \"close friends\" group to communicate with while still staying in one space/channel.\n![fig9](/tg/fig9.png)\n\nNext fig represents the competitive landscape, where the goal is to have your product/idea placed in the upper right quadrant. The new proposed feature for Telegram idea is precisely there, showing that I identified a significant gap that couild be bridged.\n![fig9](/tg/fig10.png)\n#  Conclusion\n\nAll in all, Telegram‚Äôs ability to deliver a fantastic user experience should be taken as an example for many other apps, especially those in the social messaging services spac","lastmodified":"2022-10-27T22:20:35.029512365Z","tags":null},"/notes/Work":{"title":"Work","content":"","lastmodified":"2022-10-27T22:20:35.029512365Z","tags":null}}
